My interest in web development began in 2020 when I saw the great works that a friend had developed, since then a great curiosity in the world of web development grew in me. Before this unexpected interest, I worked for over a year in a company that was dedicated to creating systems with Oracle, nevertheless, I felt that I needed to learn something new. And here you are reading my portfolio.\n\nEach project in which I have the privilege of working is a new opportunity to learn new things, in this period of time I have met people who are at a more advanced level than me, and without them knowing it, they are motivation for me!\n\nBut it's not all work, right? In my free time I love listening to music, playing video games, watching movies with very, BUT VERY good stories. I like to have a healthy life and breathe fresh air, I go hiking from time to time. I hope you enjoy these photos as much as I do: ",
